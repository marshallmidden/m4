This directory holds Linux related stuff.

The directories here at the moment are:
	3d-build
	sharedmemory
	util
	xio3d

The 3d-build directory contains scripts and stuff to build the kernel
and module for a particular target kernel - in this case Fedora FC2 test2.
This directory also winds up holding the kernel and module objects. The built
module winds up in 3d-build/xio3d-obj/xio3d.ko.

The sharedmemory directory contains two programs related to the kernel module's
shared memory.  dumpshared will dump it, and zero will zero it all out.

The util directory contains a perl script to modify the passed in network
configuration file (linux), and modify it.  It then does a restart via
/etc/init.d/network.

The xio3d directory holds the kernel module source and a
test program. The test program test.c uses the module
to mmap memory and access it.
