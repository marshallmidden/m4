install-cd - New process for making install CDs

This directory holds stuff used to make install CDs. It is normally
done by using a command like the following:

make MODEL=750 VER=F125

to make a CD for the model 750 with platform code F125. The current
"stable" apps are also loaded onto such a CD.

Unlike the old process using mkcdrec, this does not have to be done
on a controller, but rather should be done on the build machine.

The resulting iso image will have a name like:

PS-install-${MODEL}-${RELEASE}-${VER}.iso

In the example above, the resulting iso would be:

PS-install-750-0510-F125.iso
