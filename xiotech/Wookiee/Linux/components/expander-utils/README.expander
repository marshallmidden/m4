          How to Update 750 Expander Firmware

The exp_update bash script uses the sg_fwupdate utility to update the firmware
in an expander. The script expects the firmware file to be downloaded to be
placed in the file /etc/xioexp????.lod. The ???? represent the four-character
version of the firmware to be downloaded. This MUST match the version identity
that will be reported via INQUIRY when the firmware is running. For example
the 1.09d firmware is in the file /etc/xioexp109d.lod.

The exp_update script also looks for the file /etc/sysconfig/expparms to get
the version of firmware expected to be installed. When present, this file
should contain something like:

EXP_VER=109d

I /etc/sysconfig/expparms is present and the corresponding firmware file is
present, that version of expander firmware will be sent to all "enclosures"
(expanders) that are present. After sending the code to all expanders, the
script will wait for the last updated expander to "disappear" - as it does
as the update process goes on. The script then waits for there to be as many
"enclosures" (expanders) as there were when the script started.

Note that the script will also delete any /etc/xioexp*.lod files that do not
match the value in /etc/sysconfig/expparms. This is to prevent expander
firmware files from accumulating.

So, by placing two files, /etc/sysconfig/expparms and /etc/xioexp*.lod, on
a controller and invoking the exp_update script, the expander firmware can
be updated.

NOTE: There can be serious consequences for doing this. Depending on the
version change, there can be order dependencies between the two expanders.
A power loss during the update could also really ruin your day. You have been
warned.
