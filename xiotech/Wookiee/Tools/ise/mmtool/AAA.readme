This script presume that ccbCL.pl is located in this directory, and that the
library for it (XIOtech) is also in this directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea is to use MM Tool to migrate a Volume (LUN/PID) on the BE of a 7000.
i.e. Windows box with MM Tool is on the private ethernet that the ISEs are
connected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The process is:
  * Use MM Tool to start the migration of ONE (1) Volume.
  * When it pops up the window that says the migration is done and to stop all
        I/O to from the hosts, do not click READY -- do the following command
	and be ready to click READY when thie script says to do so.
  * ./migrate 172.16.1.0 8 2,4,6,8   -- or -- ./migrate 172.16.1.0 ise8 dp2
  * Then when the above script says "Press READY quickly!" -- press the READY
        button in the MM Tool to do the unpresent LUN, break mirror, and
	present new LUN from new ISE.
  * The migrate script will continue to run, find the new luns, fixes up the
        7000 data structures so that everything appears okay.
