This directory is used to make a CD that can update BIOS and BMC firmware
on controllers. The file named Instructions gives some details on updating
the settings and firmware.

The gcc-dos rpm needs to be installed to successfully run make here. It can
be obtained from the internet, or from the RustadM CVS repository.

!WARNING!
Note that some files in this area have DOS line endings. They must be left
in place so that the CD will work, because it runs DOS. Be very careful
about what your CVS client is doing. Linux works fine, with others you
are on your own.

The Makefile here can build a CD for updating different models of controllers.
Although it defaults to 3000, make can be invoked with a MODEL variable
specified, such as "make MODEL=750" to make a BIOSCD for a 750 controller.

Contents:

boards - holds BIOS update content for each motherboard

BootImages - holds floppy boot images used for initial content for the
    ElTorito CD boot. BootImage288.ima is now used as the basis for
    all CDs. The other images remain for historical interest.

src - holds source code for programs that are built and added to the boot
    floppy image on the CD.

cwsdpmi - holds the cwsdpmi distribution which was the source for the
    corresponding binary in the boot floppy image.
