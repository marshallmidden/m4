How to use the BIOSCD
---------------------------------------------
  The BIOSCD is an automated BIOS and BMC update tool.  The BIOSCD
  automatically detects the motherboard type and updates the system with the
  appropriate BIOS and BMC firmware.  After the BIOS is programmed, it applies
  the custom Xiotech CMOS settings.  The BIOSCD does *not* change the
  operating system or Mag3D application in any way.  The Mag3D system doesn't
  need to be reconfigured after running the BIOSCD.

  - Attach VGA display to be able to see messages during update.
  - Insert the CD-ROM and reboot the controller on controllers that do not
    have CD-ROM drives, use a USB-attached CD-ROM.
  - Wait for approximately 5 minutes
  - Some systems may require a reboot as part of the process.  If this occurs,
    the display will say to leave the CD in place and press the reset button.
    The next boot cycle may detect a CMOS checksum error.
    If this happens, press the F1 key to continue the boot process.
  - CD-ROM will stop with a message indicating success. You may then:
    * Remove CD-ROM from drive
    * Reboot
  - The beeper will sound with alternating pitches on update failure
    * Do not reboot!
    * Contact BIOSCD engineer


Functional layout of the BIOSCD
---------------------------------------------
  After booting, the update procedure starts by calling dooupdate.bat from the
  \bin directory. DoUpdate calls the boardid program, which is responsible for
  determining the motherboard type.  Based upon the return code from boardid,
  doupdate calls the update.bat file in the appropriate motherboard
  subdirectory.  The update batch file is responsible for calling all of the
  motherboard manufacturer's BIOS and BMC update utilities.  All batch files
  are responsible for checking and setting the RETURN_CODE environment
  variable as needed (0=GOOD, !0=ERROR).

  \bin       - (In PATH) Contains common executables
  \x6dh8.xg2 - SuperMicro x6dh8-xg2 files (BIOS and BMC)
  \x6dhr.3g2 - SuperMicro x6dhr-3g2 files (BIOS only)


How to make changes to the BIOSCD
---------------------------------------------
  Necessary equipment and software
    - CD-ROM burner and blank CD
    - CD-ROM burning software (Easy CD Creator - http://www.roxio.com)
    - gcc-dos installed (rpm available from RustadM repository)

  Updating the BIOS release and CMOS settings
    - Program the new BIOS onto a controller
    - Reboot into BIOS setup
    - Load BIOS setup defaults
    - Configure settings to specification
    - Reboot into BIOSCD
    - Press F8 at FreeDOS startup and step through boot process
    - Do not execute the "CD-ROM startup" batch file (during autoexec process)
    - Change into the controller type directory
    - Change into the BIOS directory
    - Save CMOS settings to floppy (symcmos -LB:cmos.set)
    - Copy new CMOS settings file from floppy into motherboard BIOS directory
    - Change BIOS update batch files
    - Update versions.txt with new information
    - Run "make MODEL=<model>" in the BIOS directory to build a new
      BIOSCD-<model>.iso file
    - Burn new BIOSCD using the BIOSCD-<model>.iso file
    - Test, verify, and check in changes

  Updating the BMC release
    - Copy new files into the IPMI directory
    - Remove old files from the IPMI directory
    - Change BMC update batch files
    - Update Versions.txt with new information
    - Burn new BIOSCD
    - Test, verify, and check in changes


How to check current controller versions
---------------------------------------------
  The BIOS and BMC versions are logged during every controller startup.  Through
  the CCBE, use the 'dsplogs' command and search for:
    0x10E3   Debug   SYSTEM-BIOS: Phoenix Technologies, 6.00, 11/10/2004
    0x10E3   Debug   SYSTEM-MB: Supermicro, X6DH8-XG2, 0123456789, 0123456789
    0x10E3   Debug   SYSTEM-BMC: HW:20.00 FW:0e.41

  Versions currently supported by the BIOSCD are listed in the Versions.txt
  file in the BIOSCD root directory.
