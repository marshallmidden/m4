This program takes a SnapPool and decodes it.

Required:
    a) SnapPool
    b) Vdisk information coded into snapshotwork.c, function setup_VDX()
    c) Access of SnapShot blocks inserted into try_access() in snapshotwork.c

Recommended process:
    a) Get SnapPool from controller.
        vdisks      # To get snappool and size    !-- 2 in ATTR means SnapPool.
          100     0x10        25186304    0x00  0x2100  ...
        vdiskcreate -v 200 25186304 ALL 4   # Same size, raid 10.
        vdiskcontrol 1 100 200              # Have copy manager copy to VDISK.
       When finished (poll via "vdisks" waiting for Copy% to reach 100 -- or
       look in /var/log/xiotech/apps.xiolog on controller), do:
        serverassoc 9 0 200                 # Assign to a server (Linux for me).
       On server: 
        ql-dynamic-tgt-lun-disc.sh -i
          Set Max Lun's to 1 (option 4).
          ALL HOST SCAN & REFRESH to get new disk
          quit
        ls /dev/sd*
        dmesg | grep blocks     # To see which device is the snappool. (Assume sde)
       On vwbuild:
        cd HEAD/Wookiee/Proc/snappooldecoding
        ssh -C root@10.64.102.14 "dd if=/dev/sde bs=512" >./SNAPPOOL_100e
    b) Put vdisk information into snapshotwork.c:
        Near the end of the file, there is routine setup_VDX().
        The only vdisk information needed is the SnapPool, the source of all
        SnapShots, and the SnapShots.
       1) Change the SNAPPOOL to have the correct VID (vdisk ID), RID (raid ID#), and size.
          Everything else really doesn't matter.
       2) Add all sources to SnapShots. This requires the correct VIDs, RIDs, and sizes.
          Everything else really doesn't matter.
       3) Add all SnapShots. (ccbCL.pl -- look at "raids" output for TYPE=6.)
          This needs VID, size, RID, type=6, and the source of the SnapShot for this VID.
       Compile the source "make".
    c) When finished copying the SnapPool (takes forever...):
        ./testsnapshot SNAPPOOL_100e > AAA.out 2> AAA.err
       The file AAA.out will contain the size of the SnapPool. AAA.err has the
       information printed out. *good luck*
