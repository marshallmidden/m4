For details on the conversion tool, read file CT_DOC.

This is a quick document on how to get, compile, and run the FE/BE/CCB.
    a) cvs checkout -r CT1_BR Bigfoot
    b) cd Bigfoot
    c) make clean
    d) make all
    e) make yeti
FIRST TIME, RUN ??? NOTED BELOW.
    f) make run                        # or c through f as: "make clean run"

"make help" gives possible "make" targets to help our memories.

NOTE: "f" (make run) -- one might have 3 windows and do a different command
from YetiApps/CT_START in each one:
    cd YetiApps; ./Front.t
    cd YetiApps; ./Back.t
    cd YetiApps; ./ccbrun
For debugging one might have 3 separate windows and in each do:
    cd YetiApps; root ddd Front.t
    cd YetiApps; root gdb Back.t
    cd YetiApps; root gdb ccbrun

NOTE: You may wish to have a .bashrc file with at least the following added:
    export CVSROOT=":pserver:xiotech@cvs.xiotech.com.:/usr/local/cvsroot"
    export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
    export BEDEVS=06/03.0:02/02.0
    export FEDEVS=0a/07.0:05/05.0
The latter two define the BackEnd pci bus(es) and the FrontEnd pci bus(es).

NOTE: Before doing a "run" the first time, you may wish to set up the nvram.
  Otherwise a serial port is needed to set up the controller IP, etc.
  A "make nvrsetup" will initialize for the "dot" machine you are on.

NOTE: You may need to wipe clean the controller, with it running do "make
wipeclean".  For when you need to clean everything, do "make mfg_clean".

NOTE: To set a license, use "cd CCBE; perl ccbcl dot4" (or maybe "make dot4"):
    powerupstate
    devstat
    vcgapplylicense 10235 1       -- use the one you are supplied with.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE ???: user xiotech must exist as user id number 1000, with group 1000.  The
file /opt/xiotech is it's home directory, and directory /opt/xiotech/ccbdata is
where the "nvram" configuration file is stored for the ccb, and directory for
FrontEnd and BackEnd "nvram" is /opt/xiotech/procdata.  (Please make sure the
ccbdata and procdata directories exist).

A "make install" will copy the YetiApps directory to user xiotech, in a
directory called "apps,${DATE},${TIME}".  There is a symbolic link of "apps"
to the last install done.  To run, one can login as "xiotech" with password
of "wookiee" and:
    cd apps
    ./CT_START
The CCBE (perl script ccbcl) can connect to the machine.
==============================================================================
The "magic" phrase to get "cvs commit" to work is to start the commit message
with "TBolt00000000 - " and then the commit information (no quotes).  Number
is the clearquest ticket Tbolt database entry number.  All zeros = development.
