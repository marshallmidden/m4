time.lhr-mount is the script for testing NFS cache filling and then umount.

Create program "large" via "make".

Use program "script" to save output of time.lhr-mount bash shell script.

Then copy that to working.input, and run "./working.sh" (after cleanup of it).

There is a "title" in working.sh that needs to be changed.
