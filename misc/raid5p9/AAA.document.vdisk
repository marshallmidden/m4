Need a routine to test all of raid 5 parity 9 (8+1) write possibilties.

VDISKCREATE -v VID capacity physicalDisks raidType
							  3=raid5
							    stripe
							       mirrorDepth 
								 parity
								   maxRaids
								     threshold
									flags 2 = bay redundancy
									  minPD
vdiskcreate -v 59 5184 165,136,173,201,164,135,174,202,163 3 64 2 9 8 0 0 0
vdiskcreate -v 53 5184 165,136,173,201,164,135,174,202,163 3 8 2 9 8 0 0 0

8 sectors per stripe.
Thus, 9*8 = one full round of raid5/9 cycling.
To get all permutations, that needs 9 rounds.

Thus CAPACITY is 9*8*9 for all permutations.
		648 sectors
	      5184 sectors
	      We get 16384 as minimum.
Need to test that.
a) read blocks 1 sector at a time increasing by 1 sector.
b) read blocks 2 sector at a time increasing by 1 sector.
c) read blocks 3 sector at a time increasing by 1 sector.
	...
Max write is 2mb, which is 2097152, or 4096 sectors.
