# Status of Things  
This page presents an overview of content in different languages. If you want to translate hedy to a new language, this is a good list to follow.

Please add your name in the table when you want to work on a specific thing, so others can focus on stuff that has not been started on yet. Something will get a 'V' after the pull requests gets accepted and the content is merged to the master-branch. Or, with the youtube-content, when the video is recorded and ready for uploading. Or, with the youtube-subtitling, when the subtitles are accepted and online. Happy coding/writing!

## Landing page  
Content for the landing page is stored in the [main folder](main). There currently are three pages: contact, press and start. There is also a [json file](main/menu.json) that generates the menu. The landing page is currently available in Dutch and English.

## Coding Environment
Texts in the coding environment, such as error messages, are stored in [texts.json](static/texts.json).

|Texts| V | V | V |  |  

In addition to the generic texts, the coding environment has three pages: code, explanation and videos.

### Code
Code texts are taken form the [levels file](static/levels.json), which also controls which levels are available in the interface. Only when a level is present in a given language, it will be possible to access it in the website.
  
|  |NL|EN|ES|..|

### Youtube subtitling  

Our videos now have no subtitles, but in lieu of videos in other languages, the English ones could also be subtitled. This task has not been started yet.
