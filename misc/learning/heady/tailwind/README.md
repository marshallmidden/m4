Tailwind for Hedy
=================

This directory contains the sources for Tailwind. Normally we'd include this in
our build process, but our build process is minimal and Python-based, and we
don't necessarily want to include NPM-based tooling into a Python build.

That's why Tailwind CSS is periodically generated by hand, by running:

```
$ tailwind/generate-css
```
