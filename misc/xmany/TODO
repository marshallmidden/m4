a) if you are on a multi-monitor machine, and cursor defaultly wraps
   amoungst monitors (displays), then:
      if you get to the edge of a display and move mouse very slowly,
      it wraps ok.  If fast, it don't wrap, it goes to the next monitor via
      default wrapping mechanism.
   potential fix: open big window on other monitor(s) when you are on a
   different display, and catch the wrap via window notify event.
