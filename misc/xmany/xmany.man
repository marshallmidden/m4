.SH NAME
x2x \- X to X connection
.SH SYNTAX
\fBx2x\fR  <[-to <DISPLAY>] | [-from <DISPLAY>]> [options...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
x2x allows the keyboard and mouse on one ("from") X display to be used to
control another ("to") X display.  Since x2x uses the XTEST extension,
the "to" X display must support XTEST.

In the default interface, x2x puts a window on the "from" display.
This window is labeled with the name of the "to" display.  Keystrokes
typed into this window go to the window on the "to" display that has
the input focus.  Clicking on the x2x window causes the mouse on the
"from" display to control the cursor on the "to" display.  Performing
a subsequent multiple button click on the "to" display returns control
to the "from" display.

If the -east or -west options are specified on the command line, x2x
starts up with a different interface.  When the mouse moves to the
(east or west) side of the default screen on the "from" display, the
cursor slides over to the "to" display.  When the mouse returns to
to side of the "to" display that it entered, it slides back onto
the "from" display.

Unless the -nosel option is specified, x2x relays X selections from
one display to the other.

Here are a few hints for eXcursion users (based on Intel version
2.1.309).  First, use the -big option.  Second, in the control panel,
under mouse, check the box that enables "Automatically Capture Text on
Button Up."  X selections will then automatically move into the
Windows clipboard.  As is the case with all X applications running on
2.1.309 (including x2x), you will need to do an extra mouse click
after performing the X selection for this operation to work.  x2x is
known to work poorly with eXcursion running on Windows 95, probably
due to the Windows 95 task scheduler.  x2x does work well with eXcursion
running on Windows NT.  

The hints for eXcursion are also valid for Exceed, with the exception
that X selections work better, as long as you are using x2x version
1.25 or later.

.SH OPTIONS
Either the -to option or the -from option (or both) must be specified.
.TP
.B \-to \fIdisplay\fP
.IP 
Indicates the ("to") display that is remotely controlled by the "from" display.
Default is equivalent to the default display.
.TP
.B \-from \fIdisplay\fP
.IP 
Indicates the ("from") display that remotely controls the "to" display.
Default is equivalent to the default display.
.TP
.B \-east
.IP 
Slide off the east side of the "to" display onto the "from" display.
.TP
.B \-west
.IP 
Slide off the west side of the "to" display onto the "from" display.
.TP
.B \-font \fIfontname\fP
.IP 
The font used in the x2x window. (Overridden by -east or -west.)
.TP
.B \-geometry \fIspecification\fP
.IP 
The X geometry specification for the x2x window.  
(Overridden by -east or -west.)
.TP
.B \-wait
.IP 
Tells x2x to poll the "to" and "from" displays at startup until they
are ready.  Useful for login scripts.
.TP
.B \-big
.IP 
Workaround for a bug in the cursor grab implementations of at least one
X server.  Put a big window over the "to" display in order to force the
X server to track the cursor.
.TP
.B \-buttonblock
.IP 
If this option is enabled with -east or -west, the cursor will not
slide back onto the "from" display when one or more mouse buttons
are pressed.
.TP
.B \-nomouse
.IP 
Don't capture the mouse.
(Overridden by -east or -west.)
.TP
.B \-nopointermap
.IP 
Since x2x uses XTEST, which sends input at a lower level than the
pointer button mapping, x2x needs to understand the "to" display's
button mapping and do appropriate conversion.  Use this option
to turn off the pointer button conversion.
.TP
.B \-nosel
.IP 
Don't relay the X selection between displays.
.TP
.B \-noautoup
.IP 
Normally, the autoup feature in x2x automatically lifts up all keys and 
mouse buttons when it removes the cursor from the "from" display.
.B 
Note: the autoup feature changes the state of lock functions like 
.B
Caps Lock.  The state of the lock function may not correspond to
.B
the state of the keyboard LEDs!
To disable this feature, use the \-noautoup command line option.
.TP
.B \-resurface
.IP 
Ugly hack to work-around window manager ugliness.  The -east and -west
modes actually put a small window on the side of the "from" display.
This option causes this window to resurface itself if another window
ever obscures it.  This option can cause really nasty behavior if another
application tries to do the same thing.  Useful for login scripts.
.TP
.B \-shadow \fIdisplay\fP
.IP 
Also sends mouse movements and keystrokes to this display.  Useful
for demos.  Amaze your friends: specify multiple shadows.
.TP
.B \-sticky \fIsticky-key\fP
.IP 
This option is primarily for "lock" keys like Caps_Lock.  If a lock
key only seems to work on every other press, try this option.  The
sticky option prevents autoup for the specified key.  Look in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h for a list of valid names of keys
(remove the leading XK_).
