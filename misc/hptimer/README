This program demonstrates reading the 64-bit high precision timer.
This timer is accessed using the rdtsc instruction. The timer counts
at the cpu clock rate. On some cpus, the count rate goes down when
power/thermal management kicks in, even though supposedly that is not
supposed to happen. I do not know which cpus exhibit that behavior.
