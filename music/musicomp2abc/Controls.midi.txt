GM-compatible devices are required to respond to velocity, aftertouch, and pitch bend,
to be set to specified default values at startup, and to support certain controller
numbers such as for sustain pedal, and Registered Parameter Numbers. A simplified
version of GM, called GM Lite, is used in mobile phones and other devices with limited
processing power.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CC values have a range from 0-127, from minimum to maximum value. However,
some parameters are (on/off), where 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On.

Most Common Parameters:
   1 = Modulation wheel
   2 = Breath Control
   7 = Volume
   10 = Pan
   11 = Expression
   64 = Sustain Pedal (on/off)
   65 = Portamento (on/off)
   68 = Legato FootSwitch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
   71 = Resonance (filter)
   74 = Frequency Cutoff (filter)
   91 = Effect 1 Depth  0-127 (default Reverb Send Level)
   93 = Effect 3 Depth  0-127 (default Chorus Send Level)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: There is no standard CC value for Vibrato Amount or Vibrato Speed.
Sometimes you can assign them (and other CC mappings) yourself in the software
instrument you use.

Fluidsynth has + in column 2.

First column '-' = illegal in soundfont.
First column 'f' = Default modulators in soundfonts.
First/Second column 'P' = ??

Complete List:
-+  0  Bank Select (MSB) 0-127
       Allows user to switch bank for patch selection. Program change used with
       Bank Select. MIDI can access 16,384 patches per MIDI channel.
f+  1  Modulation Wheel (MSB) 0-127
       Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness, brighness).
       What is modulated is based on the patch.
P?  2  Breath Controller (MSB) 0-127
       Oftentimes associated with aftertouch messages. It was originally intended
       for use with a breath MIDI controller in which blowing harder produced
       higher MIDI control values. It can be used for modulation as well.
    3  Undefined (MSB)
       0-127

S+ 64  Damper Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Controls sustain pedal. Nearly every synth will react to CC 64.
P+ 65  Portamento on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
P+ 66  Sostenuto Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Like the Sustain controller (CC 64), However, it only holds notes that were
       on when the pedal was pressed. People use it to hold chords and play melodies
       over the held chord.
   67  Soft Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Lowers the volume of notes played.
       "soft - The pedal on a piano, so named because it causes the damper to be
        lowered in such a way as to soften the timbre and loudness of the notes.
        In MIDI, continuous controller #66 which behaves in a similar manner."
P+ 68  Legato FootSwitch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent notes on or off.
   69  Hold 2 switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Another way to hold notes (see MIDI CC 64 and MIDI CC 66). However notes fade
       out according to their release parameter rather than when pedal is released.

#-- P+ 84  Portamento Control (LSB) - Controls the amount of Portamento (0-127).
   84  Portamento Control
          When a Note On message is received after a PTC message, the voice's
       pitch glides from the key number specified in the PTC message to the new
       Note On's pitch at the rate set by Controller 5 (Portamento Time),
       ignoring the current status of Controller 65 (Portamento On/Off).
          A PTC message only affects the next Note On received on the relevant
       MIDI channel.
          When in Poly mode, receiving a PTC message does not affect the pitch
       of any currently playing notes (whether in their sustain or release phase).
          When in Mono mode, or if Controller 68 (Legato footswitch) is On, a
       new overlapping note event results in an immediate pitch jump to the note
       number specified in the PTC message, and then a glide at the current
       portamento rate to the note number specified in the new Note On.
          For an explanation of Mono and Poly modes see the MIDI Modes
       sub-section under Channel Mode Messages.
          The note is turned off by a Note Off which matches the Note On key
       number, not the key number specified in the PTC message, irrespective
       of mode.
       Example usage To perform a glide from C4 to E4:
            MIDI data 	Description 	Result
            90 3C 40	Note On, C4	C4 On
            B0 54 3C	PTC from C4	No audible change
            90 40 40	Note On, E4	Glide from C4 to E4
            80 3C 40	Note Off, C4	No audible change
            80 40 40	Note Off, E4	E4 Off

MIDI CC 120 to 127 are Channel Mode Messages. They affect channel's operating mode.
-+120  All Sound Off  0  All sound Off.
       It does so regardless of release time or sustain. (See MIDI CC 123)
-+121  Reset All Controllers  0
       It will reset all controllers to their default.
-+122  Local Control on/off Switch  0 off, 127 on
       Turns internal connection of a MIDI keyboard or workstation, etc. on or off.
       If you use a computer, you will most likely want local control off to avoid
       notes being played twice. Once locally and twice when the note is sent back
       from the computer to your keyboard.
-P+123  All Notes Off  0
       Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be maintained, and notes
       held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal is depressed.
-P+124  Omni Mode Off  0
       Sets to Omni mode to off, + all notes off.
-P+125  Omni Mode On  0
       Sets to Omni mode on, + all notes off.
-P+126  Mono Mode On
       Sets device mode to Monophonic, + poly off, + all notes off.
       The value equals the number of channels, or 0 if the number of channels equals
       the number of voices in the receiver.
-P+127  Poly Mode  0
       Sets device mode to Polyphonic.
