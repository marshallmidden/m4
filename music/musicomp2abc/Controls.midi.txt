CC values have a range from 0-127, from minimum to maximum value. However,
some parameters are (on/off), where 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On.

Most Common Parameters:
   1 = Modulation wheel
   2 = Breath Control
   7 = Volume
   10 = Pan
   11 = Expression
   64 = Sustain Pedal (on/off)
   65 = Portamento (on/off)
   71 = Resonance (filter)
   74 = Frequency Cutoff (filter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: There is no standard CC value for Vibrato Amount or Vibrato Speed.
Sometimes you can assign them (and other CC mappings) yourself in the software
instrument you use.

Fluidsynth has + in column 2.

Complete List:
 +  0  Bank Select (MSB) 0-127
       Allows user to switch bank for patch selection. Program change used with
       Bank Select. MIDI can access 16,384 patches per MIDI channel.
 +  1  Modulation Wheel (MSB) 0-127
       Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness, brighness).
       What is modulated is based on the patch.
P?  2  Breath Controller (MSB) 0-127
       Oftentimes associated with aftertouch messages. It was originally intended
       for use with a breath MIDI controller in which blowing harder produced
       higher MIDI control values. It can be used for modulation as well.
    3  Undefined (MSB)
       0-127  
 x  4  Foot Pedal (MSB) 0-127
       Often used with aftertouch messages. It can send a continuous stream of
       values based on how the pedal is used.
Px  5  Portamento Time (MSB)  0-127
       Controls portamento rate to slide between 2 notes played subsequently.
 x  6  Data Entry (MSB)  0-127
       Controls Value for NRPN or RPN parameters.
 x  7  Channel Volume (MSB)  0-127
       Controls the volume of the channel.
 +  8  Balance (MSB)  0-127
       Controls the left and right balance, generally for stereo patches. A value of
       64 equals the center.
    9  Undefined (MSB)  0-127  
 + 10  Pan (MSB)  0-127
       Controls the left and right balance, generally for mono patches. A value of
       64 equals the center.
 + 11  Expression Controller (MSB)  0-127
       Expression is a percentage of volume (CC7).
   12  Effect Controller 1 (MSB)  0-127
       Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within synth or workstation.
   13  Effect Controller 2 (MSB)  0-127
       Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within synth or workstation.
   14  Undefined (MSB)  0-127  
   15  Undefined (MSB)  0-127  
   16 - 19  General Purpose Controllers (1 thru 4) (MSB)  0-127  
   20 - 31  Undefined (MSB)  0-127  
   32 - 63  (LSB) for Controllers 0 through 31 above - Bank Select(0) thru 31.
S+ 64  Damper Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Controls sustain pedal. Nearly every synth will react to CC 64.
P+ 65  Portamento on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
P+ 66  Sostenuto Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Like the Sustain controller (CC 64), However, it only holds notes that were
       on when the pedal was pressed. People use it to hold chords and play melodies
       over the held chord.
   67  Soft Pedal on/off switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Lowers the volume of notes played.
P+ 68  Legato FootSwitch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent notes on or off.
   69  Hold 2 switch, 0-63 off, 64-127 on.
       Another way to hold notes (see MIDI CC 64 and MIDI CC 66). However notes fade
       out according to their release parameter rather than when pedal is released.

MIDI CC 120 to 127 are Channel Mode Messages. They affect channel's operating mode.
 +120  All Sound Off  0  All sound Off.
       It does so regardless of release time or sustain. (See MIDI CC 123)
 +121  Reset All Controllers  0
       It will reset all controllers to their default.
 +122  Local Control on/off Switch  0 off, 127 on
       Turns internal connection of a MIDI keyboard or workstation, etc. on or off.
       If you use a computer, you will most likely want local control off to avoid
       notes being played twice. Once locally and twice when the note is sent back
       from the computer to your keyboard.
P+123  All Notes Off  0
       Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be maintained, and notes
       held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal is depressed.
P+124  Omni Mode Off  0
       Sets to Omni mode to off, + all notes off.
P+125  Omni Mode On  0
       Sets to Omni mode on, + all notes off.
P+126  Mono Mode On
       Sets device mode to Monophonic, + poly off, + all notes off.
       The value equals the number of channels, or 0 if the number of channels equals
       the number of voices in the receiver.
P+127  Poly Mode  0
       Sets device mode to Polyphonic.
