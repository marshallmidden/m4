    for legato, in Midi (my version) : Mono Mode Required.

    CC 5 (Portamento Time) : 0
    CC 126 (Mono) On: 0 (Channel Mode Message; value is not important; Poly=Off, Mono On Switch )
    CC 65 (Portamento On) : 127
    ... Slurred / Legato / Tenuto Notes Here ... (Attention: Minimum 1 tick overlap required.)
    CC 65 (Portamento Off) : 0
    CC 127 (Poly) On: 0 (Channel Mode Message; value is not important; Mono=Off, Poly On Switch )

    result: after first note, just sustained part plays (no attack, no decay) for following notes.

    in attachment: 1. normal playing, 2. legato playing, 3. Normal playing again.
