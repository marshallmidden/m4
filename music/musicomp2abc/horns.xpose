Calculate the interval from C to the key of the instrument.
That is the interval which the instrument transposes.
For example, from C to Bb is a descending major second (or ninth).
Bb instruments transpose down a major second (or ninth).
Eb instruments transpose up a minor third or down a major sixth.

Bass clef transpositions for horns and trumpets are based on old notation as found in Mozart.

In a 12-note approximately equally divided scale, any interval can be defined
in terms of an appropriate number of semitones.
E.g. a whole tone or major second is 2 semitones wide.
     a major third 4 semitones
     and a perfect fifth 7 semitones.
  
In music from Western culture, a seventh is a musical interval encompassing
seven staff positions, and the major seventh is one of two commonly occurring
sevenths. It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two.
The major seventh spans eleven semitones, its smaller counterpart being the
minor seventh, spanning ten semitones.
For example, the interval from C to B is a major seventh, as the note B lies
eleven semitones above C, and there are seven staff positions from C to B.
Diminished and augmented sevenths span the same number of staff positions,
but consist of a different number of semitones (nine and twelve).

Major:	c to itself	is 1st
	c to d		is 2nd
	c to e		is 3rd
	c to f		is 4th
	c to g		is 5th
	c to a		is 6th
	c to b		is 7th
	c to next c	is 8th
