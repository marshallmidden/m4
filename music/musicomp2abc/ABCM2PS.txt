%%landscape


   Output a measure number every <int> measures.
   This corresponds to the ``%%measurenb`` formatting parameter.

   This corresponds to the ``%%leftmargin`` formatting parameter.

   If a header is defined ("%%header"), this option is ignored.
   This corresponds to the ``%%scale`` formatting parameter.
   This corresponds to the ``%%staffwidth`` formatting parameter.
   This corresponds to the ``%%splittune`` formatting parameter.

   If ``%%staves`` occurs in a tune, all the voices not mentioned will not be output at all.
   A ``%%score`` directive inside a tune resets the mechanism so voices can be removed or added.
   (Similar to %%staves.)

The specifiers $1, $2, $3 and $4 can be used to change the font within a text string. The font to be used can be specified with the %%setfont-n directives. $0 resets the font to its default value. $$ gives an actual dollar sign.

11.4.4 Measure directives
%%measurefirst     <integer> % number of first measure
%%barnumbers       <integer> % bar numbers every 'n' measures
%%measurenb        <integer> % same as %%barnumbers
%%measurebox       <logical>
%%setbarnb         <integer> % set measure number

11.4.5 Text directives
%%text             <text string>
%%center           <text string>
%%begintext
%%...              <text string>
%%endtext

Notes:
    %%text prints the following text, treated as a text string.
    %%center prints the following text, treated as a text string and centred.
    %%begintext and %%endtext mark a section of lines, each of which start with %%, followed by some text. It is an alternative to several %%text lines. [Important note: some extensions offered by abc software programs relax the rule that each line between %%begintext and %%endtext must start with %%. Whilst this should not cause problems for typeset text between tunes, typeset text within a tune header or tune body should respect this rule and, in particular, must not introduce blank lines.]

11.4.6 Information directives
%%writefields <list of field identifiers> [<logical>]

The %%writefields directive allows users to choose which string-type information fields appear in the printed score (see the information fields table for a list of string-type fields). It is followed by a list of field identifiers and, optionally, the logical value true or false. If the logical value is missing it is taken as true.

The %%writefields directive also applies to certain instruction fields - namely X:reference number, P:parts and Q:tempo.

The default is "%%writefields TCOPQwW" meaning that the title (T), composer (C), origin (O), parts (P), tempo (Q), aligned words (w) and other words (W) are printed out by default (see typesetting information fields for how these should be typeset). Each subseqent %%writefields directive combines with this list, rather than overriding it.

Examples:
%%writefields O false         % the O field is not printed out - other defaults remain
%%writefields X               % the X: field is printed out
%%writefields BCDFGHNORSTWwXZ % all string-type fields are printed out

Typesetting software conforming to abc 2.1 may format the information strings in any way it chooses.

Comment: The %%writefields directive can be used in place of a number of directives introduced in abc 2.0:
    "%%writefields X" can be used as an alternative to "%%withxrefs"
    "%%writefields Ww false" can be used as an alternative to"%%musiconly"
    "%%writefields" is a partial alternative to "%%writehistory" and "%%infoname"

11.4.7 Separation directives
%%sep     % draw a horizontal separator, i.e. a line
%%vskip   % insert some vertical space
%%newpage % start a new page

11.4.8 Miscellaneous directives
%%exprabove        <logical>
%%exprbelow        <logical>
%%graceslurs       <logical> % grace notes slur to main note
%%infoline         <logical> % rhythm and origin on the same line
%%oneperpage       <logical>
%%vocalabove       <logical>
%%freegchord       <logical> % print '#', 'b' and '=' as they are
%%printtempo       <logical>
The default value for these directives is false.

11.5 Application specific directives
Applications may introduce their own directives. These directives should start with the name of the application, followed a colon, folowed by the name of the directive.

Example:
%%noteedit:fontcolor blue


%%barsperstaff 4
