To do:
a) determine measure placements.
b) determine notes within the measure:
    1) use meter_click and meter arrays.
    2) Using length of notes deterimed:
       tied/continuation notes
       legato notes
       If not exact, does a triplet work (length for next 3 notes?)
       How much 'off' is okay?
    3) key of note -> note to have in gcs.
       Always do +/-/n if not in Key for voice.
       ties/continuation notes across key changes not allowed.
    4) Hint file for voices of the same instrument ... to be combined for chords.
        Addition to the bufs_notes_voices before parsing(?).
    5) volume of note:
	A) cc 11 + cc 7 + velocity = volume of note. (rearrange numbers)
		default 11, 7, velocity.  vol()=7 (default_volume) intensity()=11 (default_intensity). 
		intensity command.
		volume/volumes command.
	B) is cc 10 (pan) changed?
		(default_pan)  pan()
		pan command 
	C) is cc 64 (damper/sustain) on/off?	NOTDONEYET message.
		(default off)
	D) is cc 68 (legato) on/off?
		(default off)
	E) is cc 91 (reverb) changed?
		(default 0 - None)
    6) key command
    7) meter command
    8) title command
    9) pitch, where is middlec?
    10) xpose certain instruments?
    11) instrument command
******************************************************************************
Ideas:
    1) fs format -> --vertical, or --staves format.
       Really want an intermediate format that has voices separated by times.
       Then see if can create --vertical format.
       Situations:
       a) legato       - test, find out what is used, etc.?
       b) note lengths - create a list of note lengths (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128).
                     And then single dotted. And then Double dotted.
                     Create list of triplets for each of the lists. (ordered)
                     Perhaps notelengthcheck[][values]. tripletcheck[][values]
                     Perhaps use prime factorization of the clicks in 0,0,Header,1?
                def print_header():
                global MIDICLICKSPERQUARTER
                print_output("0, 0, Header, 1, {}, {}".format(
                    len(volume)+1, round(MIDICLICKSPERQUARTER)))
       c) Use TimeSignature to determine Meter, and number of notes in measure.
                def print_out_midi1csv_ts():
                print_output("{}, {}, Time_signature, {}, {}, 48, 8".format(
                    voiceon+1, round(lthworkingmeasure), numerator, denominator))
       d) If chords playing, and note short (legato?), then pretend that they are
          on a 'new' voice?  Know current limit from Header/MIDICLICKSPERQUARTER.
       e) KeySignature conversion.
       f) Note: some instruments have natural xpose factor.
    2) Perhaps an input file for hints: These voices on same staff.
        a) Default: All of the same instrument on a staff.
        b) TimeSignature -- if missing.    Whole file. Perhaps by measure?
        c) KeySignature -- if missing.     By voice.   Perhaps by measure?
        d) Length of a quarter note -- in case the Header and notes are not
           printed/calculated as quarter notes from MIDICLICKSPERQUARTER.

# Need to have velocity as volume in bufs_volume array.
	bufs_volume = velocity + CC 7 + CC 10.			Fixed on output.
	Note: changing cc 7 -> intensity(xx) >/< 
	Note: changing cc 10 -> vol(xx) >/< 
	This causes velocity to be:
		createglobalvar('default_velocity', 120, 0, 0, True)    # Note attack.
		calc default_velocity=#  ??
