* This process will output notes in the proper

* form to be played on the inverted keyboard

* (accessible via -tuning  piano,inversion-).

*

* Clefs should prolly be interchanged.

* Use a -print- command to interchange the order of the

* printed staves.  Make your own -key- command based on

* the following rule (dunno how to make this automagic):

*

* Interchange notenames as follows, and interchange

* sharps with flats:

*

* e @A@D c     f @A@D b     g @A@D a

*

* For example, in the key of "d minor" (or "f major), you

* have "b" flatted, so make a key signature that has "f"

* sharped (in this case, g major or e minor).

*

* There is a global variable called "inverting" declared

* here.  This may be used to make conditially inverted

* pieces.
