* This process will print numeric volumes, named volumes,

* and positions.  Pans and crescendoes are icing on the

* cake.

*

* There is also a macro called "speed" which will print

* -tempo- commands if a full-file modify is done to change

* all -tempo- commands to -speed- commands.  It is required

* to -encode- the variable STFS (already defined here) in

* the piece to have all the staff names followed by a space

* e.g.   encode   STFS ^=viol1 viol2 viola cello bass

* and -speed- commands must not occur at the end of measure

*
