Define in detail what is needed for all this. Create steps.
TO DO:
 1) Change bufs_vol to single variable again.
 2) handle_note() undoes the 4 array onenotevolume to bufs_vol and setting:
 3)     future_cresc[voice] = [ [m,i] future_cres_volume, future_cres_direction ] -- or None
                            m = measure for starting cresc/dimin
                            i = note index within measure.
 4) At vol(), cresc(), volume, volumes commands - check if doing future and direction right, then 
        a) calculate time between,
        b) then calculate the volumes for notes between.
        c) change all notes between [m,i] and where this command occurs.

 5) Change running_vl[voice] = running_volume
        running_volume  - calculated, is a floating point number, must int(round()) to use it.
                        - volume for start of next note. (cresc/dimin sets followsing.)
    bufs_suffixes[voice,m,i] ... if 'c' in it, then cresc/dimin ... for midi/fs.
        cresc_volume[voice]    - ending volume for cresc/dimin.                - None if not calculating.
        cresc_time[voice]      - left for cresc/dimin.                         - None if not calculating.
        cresc_direction[voice] - True for up (cresc), False for down (dimin).  - None if not calculating.

DONOTDO - glide?
horn: glide 16 3c4 3d4
    The "glide" format has the same effect of synthesizer "portamento". Instead of
    jumping to a new pitch, it will glissando to each new pitch. After the staff
    name and colon, write the word "glide", followed by the length of the glide.
    In the above example, all pitches on staff "horn" will glissando for a sixteenth
    note before arriving at the next pitch. With the above, 16th note "glide" in
    effect, the above notes are played as:
        3c4 3c@D3d16t 3d8d
    horn: glide 0
    Gliding on a staff is stopped by setting the glide to zero.

Add more "ims" features. Can they be added simply?

?   f) vpp< 4c4 c gg a g2 vfff e d a   (< is crescendo from pp to vfff).
?   IGNORE:
?   a) "hide rests" ... "show rests"   Ouch -- for abc notation that is not going to happen - maybe.
    b) transpose +24.   Change for playing, not printing. transpose 0 = off. transpose -5.
    c)  tuba:   transcribe up 1 octave                  # This is for printing, not playing.
        picc:   transcribe down 2 octaves

        horn:   key c major   transcribe down to d major
        Undo via: "transcribe up 0 octaves"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To set the factor by which fermata increases a note value, "calc"
    commands are again used.  For example, "calc    fermata^=3" will cause
    all following fermatas to triple note lengths.

    The variable "arp"  specifies what fraction of a whole note that the
    notes in a chord are staggered by.  The default value is 1/32, which
    means notes in an arpeggiated chord are played one thirty-second of a
    whole note apart.  "calc    arp^=1/24" would change the interval
    between chord notes to 1/24 a whole note.

    The variables "marc" and "stac" both specify what portion of a note
    will be played, and what portion will be converted to a rest.  For
    instance, if you set the value of "marc" to .75, the note will be
    played for three-quarters of its original length, with the remainder
    of the length spent as a rest.  The default value of "marc" is .5,
    while "stac" is normally .25 .

    The variables "accent" and "aaccent" specify the amount of volume
    increase caused by the light and heavy accents ("a" and "aa").
        calc    accent^=8
        calc    aaccent^=15
    In the first example, the value of "accent" is set to "8", thus any
    OPAL note ending with "a" (light accent) will be played 8 volume
    levels louder than normal.  The second "calc" command causes all notes
    with a heavy accent ("aa") to be played 15 volume levels louder.  The
    default values of accent and aaccent are 10 and 20, respectively.
