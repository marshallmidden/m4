Add in commands:
    staff
 + TEST DECODE
    process / endprocess
        begin       <- one instance for each staff (or voice).
        quit
    keywords within staff/voice lines.

Add more "ims" features. Can they be added simply?
    1) last_command for continuation lines -- staff# -- after staff added.

?   a) "staff"                  command
?   b) [...] for chords?
?   c) v(x) (etc. for volume) i.e. v50
?      p(x) (etc. for pan) i.e. p50
?   d) treble, bass, ...        commands
?   e) fermata                  How to print in abc notation -- store with note, extend time played?
?   f) vf vp vpp vff - how implemented?    Does my putd's making them vol() satisfy?
?   g) "hide rests" ... "show rests"   Ouch -- for abc notation that is not going to happen - maybe.

    2) Lilypond used instead for printing music?
===============================================================================
Commands in IMS:        command(1) =  ...

Differences?
*   tempo           -- NOTDONEYET for accel and rit processing.
?   instrument      -- How to change for staves?
    instr           -- probably don't do, very plato specific.
    tuning          -- MIDI - what does this really mean? Is it used?
    print
    format

    To set the factor by which fermata increases a note value, "calc"
    commands are again used.  For example, "calc    fermata^=3" will cause
    all following fermatas to triple note lengths.

    The variable "arp"  specifies what fraction of a whole note that the
    notes in a chord are staggered by.  The default value is 1/32, which
    means notes in an arpeggiated chord are played one thirty-second of a
    whole note apart.  "calc    arp^=1/24" would change the interval
    between chord notes to 1/24 a whole note.

    The variables "marc" and "stac" both specify what portion of a note
    will be played, and what portion will be converted to a rest.  For
    instance, if you set the value of "marc" to .75, the note will be
    played for three-quarters of its original length, with the remainder
    of the length spent as a rest.  The default value of "marc" is .5,
    while "stac" is normally .25 .

    The variables "accent" and "aaccent" specify the amount of volume
    increase caused by the light and heavy accents ("a" and "aa").
        calc    accent^=8
        calc    aaccent^=15
    In the first example, the value of "accent" is set to "8", thus any
    OPAL note ending with "a" (light accent) will be played 8 volume
    levels louder than normal.  The second "calc" command causes all notes
    with a heavy accent ("aa") to be played 15 volume levels louder.  The
    default values of accent and aaccent are 10 and 20, respectively.
