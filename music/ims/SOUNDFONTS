* Off-the-shelf .sf2 files containing full-GM instrument banks simply don't have
  sharp attack samples. I hope they will start having them, but I don't know what
  it takes. Are single-instruments (or .sfz files) more likely to have them?
  Adding support in soundfont players for selectable articulation? MIDI 2?

  * SF2 ... forget it. SFZ can do this sort of thing already, as can Kontakt format
    and also Decent Sampler.
    SF2 is dead. It was never capable enough as a format to deal with what really
    needed to be dealt with. It is a quintessentially dated technology, and unless
    your requirements for sample libraries are very limited ("make a gong-type sound
    when I hit middle C"), SF2 is not for you.

    * To my knowledge there are no GM SFZ instrument packs which contain enough
      instruments to play any MIDI file out there
      (https://github.com/sfzinstruments/Discord-SFZ-GM-Bank has like 10 melodic
      instruments so far). So I have to pick instruments from the ground up when
      creating a DAW project (and I don't have a good collection yet), rather than
      using a unified full-GM bank as a starting point. And don't even think about
      downloading (eg. Doom) MIDI files and playing them in a soundfont of choice.

The most "GM-like" experience I've encountered in a modern commercial product is the Kontakt factory library. It has almost complete General MIDI 1 coverage, plus a handful of random additions (a dozen electric pianos, samples recorded from some vintage synths, an SATB choir singing six different vowels, several drum kits...)

This is quite a good example of the hard limitations of high-quality sampling. If you composed a violin melody line which absolutely needed a fast attack, Kontakt (a £359 library) would give you:
- A "sustain" articulation with fast attack on the loudest dynamic (which also happens to be molto vibrato), but a slower attack on quieter dynamics
- An "attack" dial which can emulate slower attacks, but not faster ones
- A "staccato" articulation which has an instant attack, but a duration of about 0.5 seconds
- No legato, so even if you get the attack right, fast runs and ornaments are going to sound a little strange
I've encountered similar limitations with dedicated orchestral libraries. If it's not the attack, it's the expression, or the maximum note duration, or the speed of an ornament, or the timbre of the specific instrument they recorded, or something else which always dangles perfection just out of your reach.
I suspect you'd have similar problems with even the most expensive sample libraries; it's one more reason to opt out of that game altogether. If you lower your standards for audio fidelity, your musical freedom increases. When you're composing for the Nintendo DS, nobody's going to notice if you manually tweak the attack of your string sample, or fake an ornament using pitch-bend, or crossfade between two velocity layers.
SWAM is one possible escape route, but you're correct that it costs a fortune. It also has high CPU requirements, so you might need to bounce your SWAM parts to an audio track, and you'd have limited ability to put together seven SWAM violins and call it a "violin section".
