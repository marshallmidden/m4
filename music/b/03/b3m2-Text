This is computer generated. There are 31 'channels' needed for Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, Movement 2.

A Midi file can only have 16 channels -- but you can cheat by putting the same instrument into one channel with multiple note-on/note-off overlapping. This fails if both are playing the same note. Also legato and other midi effects.

The text file is in GCS format era 1975-1978. I converted musicomp from Tutor to python, added crescendo, tempo changes, largo, etc. Then added the late 1978 IMS chord format. Output from the translation program can be:
    a) abc format (nice for viewing notes on screen),
    b) csv (comma separated values) [think excel spread sheet], and csvmidi to translate into a midi file,
    c) fluidsynth input format.

Fluidsynth input method can have more than 16 channels/instruments simultaneously playing.
This uses GeneralUser_GS.sf2 for instruments.
It has been verified by viewing for key signatures, etc. with abcm2ps.

The Makefile will create the various formats for playing/viewing. [Path fixing required.]

It may seem complicated, but both music and programming can be... :)

It was in the 1920s that Leopold Stokowski, the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, changed the orchestral instrument seating chart.

In addition, the audience is not directly in the middle of the instruments as the director is, but about the depth of the stage away from the stage. The "pan" for the instruments has been changed to match this location. As if you have a 45 degree view out of each eye of the stage.
