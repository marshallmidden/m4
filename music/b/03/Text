Description:
********* NOTDONEYET *********
Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, 1st Movement (of 4) - gcs format - 2024-??-??

This is computer generated. There are ?? 'channels' needed for Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, movement 1.

A Midi file can only have 16 channels -- but you can cheat by putting the same instrument into one channel with multiple note-on/note-off overlapping. This fails if both are playing the same note. Also legato and other midi effects.

The text file is in GCS format era 1975-1978. I converted musicomp from Tutor to python, added crescendo, tempo changes, largo, etc. Then added the late 1978 IMS chord format. Output from the translation program can be:
    a) abc format (nice for viewing notes on screen),
    b) csv (comma separated values) [think excel spread sheet], and csvmidi to translate into a midi file,
    c) fluidsynth input format.

Fluidsynth input method can have more than 16 channels/instruments simultaneously playing.
This uses GeneralUser_GS.sf2 for instruments.
It has been verified by viewing for key signatures, etc. with abcm2ps.

The Makefile will create the various formats for playing/viewing.

It may seem complicated, but both music and programming can be... :)
