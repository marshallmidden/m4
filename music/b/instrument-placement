While we use the term “seating” to describe the arrangement of instruments in
the performance space, this is misleading. During the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries musicians generally stood for performances, except for
cellists and keyboardists. There are several images and descriptions of
instrument configurations from the years surrounding 1800, from opera houses,
festivals, chamber and other instrumental performances. While these indicate
a variety of possibilities, a few consistencies do present themselves:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Violins are to the front of the space, with violin 1 and violin 2 on
    opposite sides (violin one usually to the left of the “leader,” or stage
    right, and violin 2 on the other side, stage left).
 *  At least one cello and double bass would be near the keyboard (if present),
    near the middle of the setup, thus aiding in the basso stating together.
    Sections of cellos and double basses would be near the back and distributed
    on both side of the performance area (stage right and left), often behind
    the violins.
 *  Violas go wherever they could fit, and as with cellos and basses, usually
    distributed on both sides of the setup.
 *  Woodwinds and horns stood together, usually in a line.
 *  Trumpets, timpani, and trombones if used, stood to the back.
 *  In the case of choral concerts, singers would usually be in front of the
    instruments, towards the audience.

Angles determined by sitting the depth of the stage away from the stage.
From the left, angles are 45 for left of stage and 135 for right of the stage.

PAN is 0 for 0 degrees, 127 for 180 degrees.
Formula = Degrees -> PAN
      0 to 180 = 0 to 127
      Degrees * (64/90) = Pan.
