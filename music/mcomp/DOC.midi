The contents of the MIDI stream represented by this example are broken down here:

The entire format 0 MIDI file contents in hex follow. First, the header chunk:
    4D 54 68 64         MThd
    00 00 00 06         chunk length
    00 00               format 0
    00 01               one track
    00 60               96 per quarter-note
Then the track chunk. Its header followed by the events (notice the running status is used in places):
    4D 54 72 6B         MTrk
    00 00 00 3B         chunk length (59)
Delta-Time      Event                   Comments
    00          FF 58 04 04 02 18 08    time signature
    00          FF 51 03 07 A1 20       tempo
    00          C0 05
    00          C1 2E
    00          C2 46
    00          92 30 60
    00          3C 60                   running status
    60          91 43 40
    60          90 4C 20
    81 40       82 30 40                two-byte delta-time
    00          3C 40                   running status
    00          81 43 40
    00          80 4C 40
    00          FF 2F 00                end of track
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A format 1 representation of the file is slightly different. Its header chunk:
    4D 54 68 64     MThd
    00 00 00 06     chunk length
    00 01           format 1
    00 04           four tracks
    00 60           96 per quarter note
First, the track chunk for the time signature/tempo track. Its header, followed by the events:
    4D 54 72 6B     MTrk
    00 00 00 14     chunk length (20)
Delta-Time      Event                   Comments
    00          FF 58 04 04 02 18 08    time signature
    00          FF 51 03 07 A1 20       tempo
    83 00       FF 2F 00                end of track
Then, the track chunk for the first music track. The MIDI convention for note on/off running
status is used in this example:
    4D 54 72 6B     MTrk
    00 00 00 10     chunk length (16)
Delta-Time      Event                   Comments
    00          C0 05
    81 40       90 4C 20
    81 40       4C 00                   Running status: note on, vel=0
    00          FF 2F 00
Then, the track chunk for the second music track:
    4D 54 72 6B     MTrk
    00 00 00 0F     chunk length (15)
Delta-Time      Event                   Comments
    00          C1 2E
    60          91 43 40
    82 20       43 00                   running status
    00          FF 2F 00                end of track
Then, the track chunk for the third music track:
    4D 54 72 6B     MTrk
    00 00 00 15     chunk length (21)
Delta-Time      Event                   Comments
    00          C2 46
    00          92 30 60
    00          3C 60                   running status
    83 00       30 00                   two-byte delta-time, running status
    00          3C 00                   running status
    00          FF 2F 00 	        end of track
